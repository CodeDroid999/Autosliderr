## Carousel
A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text—like a carousel.

## How it works
The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built HTML5,CSS transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.

In browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is minimized, etc.).
